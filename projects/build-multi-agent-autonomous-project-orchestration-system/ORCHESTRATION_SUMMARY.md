## Feature Highlights

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Workspace-configurable agent concurrency** (default: 3 agents)
- **Agent assignment to GitHub Projects** (one project per agent at a time)
- **Automated code review workflow** after project completion
- **Iterative refinement** until quality standards are met

### Autonomous Project Generation
- **21 predefined improvement categories** (Optimization, Innovation, Architecture, Security, Testing, Documentation, Technical Debt, DevOps, Accessibility, Dependency Management, Data Management, i18n, Error Handling, Code Quality, Compliance, Scalability, API Evolution, and more)
- **Category-based ideation prompts** for each category type
- **Integration with `/project-create`** for autonomous project creation
- **Self-sustaining improvement loop** (execution → review → ideation → creation)

### Quality & Safety
- **Automated acceptance criteria validation**
- **CI/CD pass rate monitoring** (>95% target)
- **Review cycle limits** (<3 iterations)
- **Cost tracking and budget enforcement**
- **Emergency stop controls** (<30s response time)

## Next Steps

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Product Feature Brief: `./projects/build-multi-agent-autonomous-project-orchestration-system/pfb.md`
   - Product Requirements Document: `./projects/build-multi-agent-autonomous-project-orchestration-system/prd.md`
   - Full Problem Description: `./projects/build-multi-agent-autonomous-project-orchestration-system/problem-description-full.md`

2. **Visit Project Board**
   - https://github.com/orgs/stokedconsulting/projects/79
   - All 30 items ready for assignment

3. **Assign Team Members**
   - Assign developers to Phase 1 work items
   - Set priority and size estimates using project fields
   - Configure workflow automation if desired

4. **Begin Phase 1 Implementation**
   - Start with foundational work items (1.1-1.5)
   - Ensure agent state management is solid before moving to Phase 2
   - Each work item has detailed Implementation Details, Acceptance Criteria, and Acceptance Tests

5. **Execute Project with Automation**
   - Once implemented, use `/project-start 79` to begin autonomous execution
   - Monitor agents via dashboard
   - Review quality metrics
   - Observe self-sustaining improvement loop

## State File

All orchestration state saved to:
`./projects/build-multi-agent-autonomous-project-orchestration-system/orchestration-state.json`

Includes:
- Problem description metadata (word count, paths, preprocessing flag)
- All stage completion markers
- PFB and PRD file paths
- GitHub project details (owner, repo, number, ID, URL)
- All issue numbers (master and work items)
- Phase structure with work item mappings

## Preprocessing Summary

**Large input detected:** 420 words (> 350 threshold)

**Preprocessing activated:**
- ✅ Concise summary generated (258 words)
- ✅ Full description preserved for reference
- ✅ Summary used for orchestration (faster, more focused)
- ✅ Full context available to subagents when needed

This prevented context overflow and ensured successful completion of all stages.
