  "problem_description": "lets create an api for this extension that is modeled off the nest api in ../v3/packages/api which deploys from sst when the new pnpm deploy:prod command is executed.. it should run behind localhost:8167.. this api will keep track of the state of the various projects that are being worked from what machine or potentially what machine + docker slot.. and when the last orchestration task was made and what it was working on.. it should store the data in our same ../v3 mongo atlas database using senvn but lets make a new stoked-projects dbname.. eventually we may make a ui but for now the ui will be this extension..",
